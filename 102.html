                A Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death <br>
                at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath. The animals, his subjects, <br>
                came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more helpless. When <br>
                they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves: "Now is the <br>
                time to pay off old grudges." So the Boar came up and drove at him with his tusks; <br>
                then a Bull gored him with his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the Ass, <br>
                feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the Lion kicked up his heels <br>
                into his face. "This is a double death " growled the Lion. Only cowards insult dying majesty
